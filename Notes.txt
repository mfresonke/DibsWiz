-- User states
  - Available
  - Booked (with ID)
  - Not Available

-- Going Through Meet Ups Scheduling Texts to be Sent --
  -> Have Group Filled Which Has User IDs
  -> Have Reservations Which Has Users That Have Filled Them (Along With Some Potentially Without)

  Problem: I'm In Meetup X, and need to know if user Y has already been scheduled for Another Meet Up.
  Potential Solutions:
    - Store Scheduled Information in User

-- Things to Implement
  - Names back into user
  - Nicknames now part of group.

-- I Have a Time and Day of Week. I want to find all rooms available.
  - Find all Meetups that are within that time.
